# Invoice Online

Simple single page app all in HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Fill it out, print to PDF or to 
paper. See [live demo](https://plip.com/InvoiceOnline)!

## Use

1. Download this repo
1. Open `index.html` in a browser
1. Add line items and fill out each line's detail.. Adding a new line item uses the prior lines item price.
1. Print and send
1. Profit! 

Optionally, you could have the 2nd step above be "put in web accessible directory", but this app works both with and with a web server.  The simplicity of just HTML/CSS/JavaScript!!

**Note** -  This does not support saving and editing old invoice.  Just simple one off invoice creating ;)
